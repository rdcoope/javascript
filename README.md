Basic notes and new commands learned. 

Standard practice is to use camelCase 
camelCase is where the first letter of word 
2+ is capitalized. 

When hard coding a constant variable use all caps
with words seperated by underscores. This way you
you can differentiate what is hard coded and what
is system assigned.
