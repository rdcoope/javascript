Basic notes and new commands learned. 

Standard practice is to use camelCase 
camelCase is where the first letter of word 
2+ is capitalized. 

When hard coding a constant variable use all caps
with words seperated by underscores. This way you
you can differentiate what is hard coded and what
is system assigned.

if, else, else if can be used for decision making
and branching paths in said decisions.
    if MUST be all lowercase or javaScript will 
    throw an error

switch is used to specify many alternative blocks of code to execute

|| is used as an OR statement to choose between 2 conditions
    **example
    (true || true) returns true
    (true || false) returns true
    (false || true) returns true
    (false || false) returns false
Multiple || statemetns can be chained together and 
the first true value will be returned. If all values 
return flase then the last value in the list will
 be returned

&& is an AND statement. Both conditions must be 
true for this to return true.
    **example
    (true || true) returns true
    (true||False) returns false
    (false||true) returns false
    (false||false) returns false
