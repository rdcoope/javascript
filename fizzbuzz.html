        <p>Here is a thought process using the "FizzBuzz" technique</p>
        <p>In simple terms, FizzBuzz is a simple number replacement where 
            numbers divisible by 3 are replaced with Fizz and numbers divisible 
            by 5 are replaced with Buzz. Any numbers divisible by both are replaced by FizzBuzz.
        </p>

    <div class="code">
        <p>Here is my Pseudo-Code for this
            <ol>
                <li>generate a list of numbers from 1 to x (lets say x is 100 for now)</li>
                <li>itterate through the list</li>
                <li>Check if each number is divisible by 3</li>
                <li>Replace 3 with Fizz</li>
                <li>Check if number is divisible by 5</li>
                <li>Replace 5 with Buzz</li>
                <li><ul>
                    <li>if the number is divisible by 5 see if the number is divisible by 3</li>
                    <li>check if divisible by 3 and 5</li>
                    <li>if both are true, replace number with FizzBuzz</li>
                </ul>
                </li>

            </ol>

        let answer = parseInt(prompt("Please enter the number you would like to FIzzBuzz up to: "))

            for (let i = 1; i <= answer; i++){
                if ((i % 3 === 0) && (i % 5 ===0)){
